Precision Dial generation tool is a customizable and automated dial generation tool designed to create high-precision dials for measurement instruments, control panels, and other display applications

# Description:
Precision Dial generation tool is a customizable and automated dial generation tool designed to create high-precision dials for measurement instruments, control panels, and other display applications. Built with flexibility in mind, it allows users to define key parameters such as **scale range, tick spacing (including non-linear configurations), dial shape, and cardinal markers** to produce SVG output that meets specific design requirements.

# Features:

* **Automated SVG Generation**: Generates SVG files of dials based on user-defined inputs, eliminating the need for manual adjustments in design software.
* **Configurable Scale and Cardinal Settings**: Allows setting major and minor ticks, non-linear tick spacing, and scale range for tailored dial design.
* **Flexible Dial Shapes**: Supports various dial shapes, including quarter, semi, and full circles.
* **Professional Design Control**: Fine-tune parameters like tick thickness, accuracy markings, and label placement to meet industry standards.
* **Built-in Units and Metrics Display**: Provides options to add units, manufacturer logos, and additional accuracy indicators on the dial layout.

# Use Cases:
Ideal for engineers, designers, and technicians who require precise, scalable, and customizable dials for electrical, mechanical, or scientific instruments. DialDesignPro streamlines the design process, making it easier to create professional-grade dials suitable for both industrial and educational applications.

# How to Use:
1. Define your desired parameters such as num_major, num_minor, full_scale, dial_shape, and other specifications.
2. Run the code to generate an SVG file that meets your requirements.
3. Review and implement the SVG output in your instrument design.
